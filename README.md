# 🎓 Predicting Student Placement Outcomes

This project focuses on predicting whether a student will be placed after graduation using logistic regression. The analysis was conducted on a dataset of 10,000 students, combining academic records, professional experiences, and personal development indicators.

## 📌 Objective

To build a predictive model that identifies key factors influencing student placement status. The goal is to help educational institutions detect at-risk students early and offer targeted support to improve their chances of employment.

## 🧠 What the Model Considered

The logistic regression model used a mix of:
- **Academic features**: CGPA, SSC (10th), HSC (12th)
- **Professional exposure**: Internships, Projects, Certifications
- **Skill & personality traits**: Soft skill ratings, Aptitude test scores, Extracurriculars, Placement training

The target variable was **PlacementStatus** (placed / not placed).

## 🔍 Key Insights

By analyzing various factors, the project aimed to highlight which student attributes most strongly influenced placement outcomes. This kind of modeling can support universities in making data-driven improvements to student development programs.
